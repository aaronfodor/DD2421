    "Based on the provided training data, the decision trees have been generated properly (training error = 0 indicates that). Based on the test set errors, it looks like MONK-2 is the dataset where our decision tree approach struggles the most:\r\n",
    "- On MONK-1, there is ~17% error rate. With this dataset, attribute 5 produced a significant information gain (~28%) at the beginning. Based on this, this dataset looked like to be relatively efficiently solvable with our approach, which has been confirmed.\r\n",
    "- On MONK-2, the error rate is more than 30%. This is however not a surprise, as the information gain looked like to be marginal for each attribute (maximum ~1.7%). The reason is that the relation 'exactly two' is somewhat difficult to express with predicate calculus, so it is also difficult to model. To model it properly, 432 distinct records are needed for each attribute dual combinations (because here, all needs to be properly modelled). But in this training set, there are only 169 records. \r\n",
    "- On MONK-3, the error rate is 5.5%, which is the best out of the three. It is worth mentioning that MONK-3's training set has an additional 5% noise. Without this, the tree would perform even better. The size of the tree suggests that the information gain was significant when slicing the data. This was somehow expected, as both A5 and A2 indicated significant information gains (~25% and ~29%) earlier, so the good performance on this dataset is not a surprise."
